Changes in 0.4.2

New features:
	- new command-line tool pynag introduced (deprecated pynag-maincfg, etc).
	pynag utility offers an easy way to create/update/delete configuration
	objects from the command line. (palli@opensource.is)

	- Model: ObjectDefinition.attributes are now defined according to
	documentation, no longer dynamically created in order to ensure consistency
	(palli@opensource.is)

	- Model: run_check_command() available for hosts and services
	(palli@opensource.is)

	via new AttributeList class (palli@opensource.is)

    (palli@opensource.is)

Bugs fixed:
    - Model, ObjectDefinition.copy() now returns a copy of the newly created object

    - Parsers, Appending cfg_dir to nagios maincfg and pathnames dont match
	exactly what is in config before (for example double slashes would cause a
	duplicate)

	- Parsers: Cache is no longer reloaded as often (improves performance)
	(palli@opensource.is)

	- Parsers: Properly raise ParserError if unexpected '}' is encountered
	while Parsing (palli@opensource.is)

	- Parsers: ParserError class now has cleaner more detailed output
	(palli@opensource.is)

	- Model: get_all_macros() now returns custom macros (palli@opensource.is)

	- Fixed key errors where data is not present (tommi@tommi.org)
