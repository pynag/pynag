=head1 NAME

pynag - command line front for manipulating nagios configuration

=head1 SYNOPSIS

pynag <sub-command> [options] [arguments]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

pynag is a command-line utility that can be used to view or change current nagios configuration.

=head1 sub-commands

=head2 list

print to screen nagios configuration objects as specified by a WHERE clause

	pynag list [attribute1] [attribute2] [WHERE ...]

=head2 update

modify specific attributes of nagios objects as specified by a WHERE and SET clause

	pynag update set attr1=value WHERE attr=value and attr=value


=head2 delete

Delete objects from nagios configuration as specified by a WHERE clause

	pynag delete delete <WHERE ...>

=head2 add 

Add a new object definition

	pynag add <object_type> <attr1=value1> [attr2=value2]

=head2 copy

Copy objects, specifiying which attributes to change

	pynag copy <WHERE ...> <SET attr1=value1 [attr2=value2] ...>

=head2 execute

Executes the currently configured check command for a host or a service

	pynag execute <host_name> [service_description]
	
=head2 config

modify values in main nagios configuration file (nagios.cfg)

	pynag config [--set <attribute=value>] [--old_value=attribute]
	pynag config [--append <attribute=value>] [--old_value=attribute]
	pynag config [--remove <attribute>] [--old_value=attribute]
	pynag config [--get <attribute>] 


=head1 WHERE statements

Some Subcommands use WHERE statements to filter which objects to work with.
Where has certain similarity with SQL syntax.

Syntax:

	WHERE <attr=value> [AND attr=value] [OR attr=value] [another where statement]

where "attr" is any nagios attribute (i.e. host_name or service_description).

Example:

	pynag list WHERE host_name=localhost and object_type=service
	pynag list WHERE object_type=host or object_type=service

Any search attributes have the same syntax as the pynag filter. For example these
work just fine:

	pynag list WHERE host_name__contains=production
	pynag list WHERE host_name__startswith=prod
	pynag list WHERE host_name__notcontains=test
	pynag list host_name address WHERE address__exists=True
	pynag list host_name WHERE register__isnot=0


The pynag filter supports few parameters that are not just attributes. Example:

	filename                 -- The filename which the object belongs to
	id                       -- pynag unique identifier for the object
	effective_command_line   -- command which nagios will execute

Of course these can be combined with the pynag filter syntax:

	pynag list where filename__startswith=/etc/nagios/conf.d/
	pynag list host_name service_description effective_command_line

For detailed description of the filter see pydoc for pynag.Model.ObjectDefintion.filter()


=head1 SET statements

Subcommands that use SET statements (like update or copy) use them a list of attributes
change for a specific object.

Syntax:

	SET <attr1=value1> [attr2=value2] [...]

Example:

	pynag update SET address=127.0.0.1 WHERE host_name=localhost and object_type=host

=head1 EXAMPLES

List all services that have "myhost" as a host_name

	pynag list host_name service_description WHERE host_name=myhost and object_type=service

Set check_period to 24x7 on all services that belong to host "myhost":

	pynag update set check_period=24x7 WHERE host_name=myhost 

=head2 list examples

	# pynag list host_name address WHERE object_type=host"
	# pynag list host_name service_description WHERE host_name=examplehost and object_type=service"

=head2 update examples

	# pynag update SET host_name=newhostname WHERE host_name=oldhostname"
	# pynag update SET address=127.0.0.1 WHERE host_name='examplehost.example.com' and object_type=host"
	
	# pynag update UNSET contacts WHERE host_name='examplehost.example.com' and object_type=host"

=head2 copy examples

	# pynag copy SET host_name=newhostname WHERE  host_name=oldhostname"
	# pynag copy SET address=127.0.0.1 WHERE host_name='examplehost.example.com' and object_type=host"

=head2 add examples

	# pynag add host host_name=examplehost use=generic-host address=127.0.0.1"
	# pynag add service service_description="Test Service" use="check_nrpe" host_name="localhost"

=head2 delete examples

	# pynag delete where object_type=service and host_name='mydeprecated_host'
	# pynag delete where filename__startswith='/etc/nagios/myoldhosts'

=head2 execute examples

	# pynag execute localhost
	# pynag execute localhost "Disk Space"
